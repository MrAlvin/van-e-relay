# Automotive High-Side Electronic Relay PCB
This board is an 8-channel Electronic Relay - where you can turn things on/off on the plus wire. 

Being able to switch on/off on the plus wire is of particular use in Cars and Vans, as the minus wire is typically replaced by using the metalic chassis of a car or van. And thus it becomes very necessary to be able to operate on/off switches on the plus wire. 

This PCB is 
 - Version C4-F
 - Revision C4-F2
 - Date: 2023-12-10

 Status is: Un-Tested - (Noted 2023-12-15) PCB has been produced, and is in transit


The file "PWR-P8x-C4F2-gerber.zip" is production ready, and can be uploaded, as is, to a PCB manufacturer.


The PCB Design software used is: Sprinter-Layout-6

The PCB is designed as a double-sided (2-layer) PCB.
 - all copper paths are a minimum of 0.3 mm wide. 
 - the smallest holes are 0.5mm Ã˜ (diameter).
 - the Minimum Annular ring is 0.2 mm
 - the distance between copper paths are  9 mil 
So this should work fine for both 1 oz (standard), or 2 oz copper PCB production.
